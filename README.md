# INFO474-FinalProject

Our group will be exploring the research question of "How severely has the coronavirus 
outbreak impacted the origin Hubei, then China, and eventually the globe in the time period starting from January 21?"
We will analyze the relevant data from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/wuhan-coronavirus-a-geographical-analysis).

During December 2019, “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”) are detected from 
people working at Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market. Later, a growing number of patients 
reported they were not exposed to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. Unfortunately, 
it was the lunar new year and a huge amount of people returned to their hometown from Wuhan during spring break, 
which allows the outbreak to spread to other provinces rapidly. And later on January 30, 2020, the International 
Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a “public health emergency 
of international concern”(PHEIC), which increases the general fear among the public. As the four members of our group are 
all international students from China, we are highly concerned about this novel coronavirus outbreak. We want to explore how 
the numbers of confirmed, death, and recovered cases change over time and see how it spread geographically to gain insights 
about this peculiar and terrifying virus that has had a great impact on the lives of a myriad of people around the globe up to now.

* We used d3 to create a map with circles showing the provinces of China that have people infected by COVID-19 by 2/4/2020.
